                            <li>1/4 cup niter kebbeh or ghee spiced butter</li>
                            <li>2 pounds venison, lamb or beef, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>  
                            <li>2 tablespoons berbere</li>

                            <li>1 to 5 green chiles, such as jalapenos or serranos</li>  
                            <li>1/2 cup red wine </li>

                            <li>Get the saute pan or wok very hot. Stir-fry the onions without the butter for a few minutes, until they char just a little on the outside. Add the spiced butter and the venison. Stir-fry hot and fast until the outside of the meat is brown but the inside of the meat is still very rare. You need to do this on as hot a burner as you have. Do it in two batches unless you have a very large wok or pan.</li>
                            <li>The moment the meat has browned, add it all back into the pan along with the spices, garlic and chiles. Stir-fry another 30 seconds or so, then add the tomatoes and the wine. Toss to combine and let this cook for a minute or two. Serve at once with bread or injera.</li>
